# Showreel Design

This project is a web application for showcasing video showreels, built with Astro.

## ðŸš€ Development Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```sh

2.  **Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
